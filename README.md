# Popular Movies App
This is a fully functional app that allows you to view the most popular or highest rated movies. 
This app can be used on both phone and tablets. 

# Working with the source code
This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve the movies. You must provide your own personal API key in order to use the app. The api key should be placed in the strings.xml file.
